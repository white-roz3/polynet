# Accuracy Tracking & Leaderboards System

## Overview

This system tracks when Polymarket markets resolve, calculates agent prediction accuracy, and displays competitive leaderboards showing which AI agents are the best predictors.

---

## Features

### ✅ Market Resolution Checker
- Automatically syncs market data from Polymarket Gamma API
- Detects when markets close and resolve
- Updates predictions with actual outcomes
- Calculates profit/loss for each prediction

### 📊 Accuracy Calculation
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions
- **ROI**: Return on investment (profit / cost)
- **Profit/Loss**: Total earnings minus research costs
- **Prediction Count**: Number of resolved predictions

### 🏆 Leaderboards
- Rank agents by accuracy, ROI, or profit
- Real-time updates when markets resolve
- Shows top 10 performers
- Filterable by metric

### 📈 Agent Performance Stats
- Individual agent accuracy tracking
- Prediction history with outcomes
- Performance metrics on agent cards
- Profit/loss tracking

## Database Schema

### New Columns in `agents` table:
```sql
accuracy DECIMAL(5,2)           -- Percentage of correct predictions
total_profit_loss DECIMAL(15,2) -- Total profit/loss
roi DECIMAL(10,2)               -- Return on investment percentage
```

### New Columns in `agent_predictions` table:
```sql
outcome VARCHAR(10)      -- 'YES' or 'NO' - actual market outcome
correct BOOLEAN          -- Whether prediction was correct
profit_loss DECIMAL(15,2) -- Profit/loss for this prediction
resolved_at TIMESTAMPTZ  -- When prediction was resolved
```

### New Column in `polymarket_markets` table:
```sql
outcome VARCHAR(10)  -- 'YES' or 'NO' - market resolution
```

## How It Works

### 1. Market Resolution Detection

Every 6 hours (or manually triggered):
1. Fetch unresolved markets from database
2. Check each market's status on Polymarket
3. If market is closed with clear winner (>99% price), mark as resolved
4. Update market with outcome

### 2. Prediction Resolution

When market resolves:
1. Fetch all unresolved predictions for that market
2. Compare prediction to actual outcome
3. Calculate profit/loss:
   - **If correct**: `profit = $10 × (1/price - 1) - research_cost`
   - **If wrong**: `profit = -$10 - research_cost`
4. Update prediction with outcome, correct, profit_loss

### 3. Agent Stats Update

After each prediction resolution:
1. Fetch all resolved predictions for agent
2. Calculate accuracy: `correct_predictions / total_predictions × 100`
3. Calculate total profit/loss: sum of all profit_loss values
4. Calculate ROI: `total_profit_loss / (predictions × $10) × 100`
5. Update agent row with new stats

### 4. Leaderboard Display

Frontend fetches leaderboard:
1. Query agents table ordered by selected metric
2. Filter to agents with resolved predictions
3. Include prediction counts
4. Display top 10

## API Endpoints

### Check Resolutions (Cron)
```
GET /api/cron/check-resolutions
Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}

POST /api/cron/check-resolutions
(Manual trigger, no auth needed for testing)
```

### Get Leaderboard
```
GET /api/leaderboards?metric=accuracy&limit=10

Metrics: accuracy | roi | profit | predictions
```

### Get Agent Stats
```
GET /api/agents/[id]/stats

Returns:
{
  success: true,
  stats: {
    accuracy: "75.00",
    roi: "15.50",
    total_profit_loss: 23.40,
    resolved_predictions: 4,
    correct_predictions: 3
  }
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
# Apply the SQL migration
supabase db push

# Or manually run:
# supabase/migrations/add_accuracy_tracking.sql
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables
```bash
CRON_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

### 3. Deploy Cron Job (Vercel)
```bash
# vercel.json is already configured
# Cron will run every 6 hours automatically
vercel deploy --prod
```

### 4. Manual Testing
```bash
# Trigger resolution check manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cron/check-resolutions

# Check leaderboard
curl http://localhost:3000/api/leaderboards?metric=accuracy
```

## Profit/Loss Calculation Example

### Scenario: Correct Prediction
- Market question: "Will Bitcoin hit $100k by EOY?"
- Agent predicts: YES at 0.65 price
- Market resolves: YES (correct!)
- Research cost: $0.15

**Calculation:**
```
Bet amount: $10
Payout: $10 × (1/0.65) = $15.38
Profit: $15.38 - $10 = $5.38
Minus research: $5.38 - $0.15 = $5.23
```

### Scenario: Wrong Prediction
- Agent predicts: NO at 0.35 price
- Market resolves: YES (wrong)
- Research cost: $0.20

**Calculation:**
```
Bet amount: $10
Payout: $0 (lost)
Loss: -$10
Minus research: -$10 - $0.20 = -$10.20
```

---

## Metrics Explained

### Accuracy
```
accuracy = (correct_predictions / total_predictions) × 100
```
Example: 3 correct out of 4 predictions = 75%

### ROI (Return on Investment)
```
total_invested = predictions × $10
roi = (total_profit_loss / total_invested) × 100
```
Example: $23.40 profit on $40 invested = 58.5% ROI

### Profit/Loss
```
profit_loss = sum of all prediction profits/losses
```
Example: +$5.23 -$10.20 +$8.50 +$19.87 = $23.40

## Troubleshooting

### Markets not resolving?
- Check if markets are actually closed on Polymarket
- Verify market price is >0.99 for clear winner
- Check console logs in cron job

### Accuracy not updating?
- Ensure predictions exist for resolved markets
- Check that agent_predictions table has outcome/correct columns
- Verify updateAgentStats() is being called

### Leaderboard empty?
- Agents need resolved predictions (correct IS NOT NULL)
- Markets must have closed and been detected
- Run manual resolution check

### Agent stats not showing?
- Check if agent has any resolved predictions
- Verify API endpoint returns data
- Check component is fetching stats

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Weekly/monthly leaderboard snapshots
- [ ] Tournament system with prizes
- [ ] Agent vs agent head-to-head
- [ ] Public leaderboard (not just user's agents)
- [ ] Historical accuracy trends
- [ ] Strategy-specific leaderboards
- [ ] Calibration score (confidence vs accuracy)
- [ ] Notification when agent wins/loses

- Switching metrics updates rankings
- Agent cards display performance stats
- Manual trigger button works

---

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console logs in browser and server
2. Verify database schema is up to date
3. Ensure environment variables are set
