## Environment Variables Needed

Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
# Existing (you should already have these)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key

# NEW - Cron security
CRON_SECRET=generate_a_random_32_char_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_CRON_SECRET=same_as_above

# Generate secret with:
# openssl rand -base64 32
```

---

## Testing Locally

### 1. Go to http://localhost:3001/dashboard

You should see the updated **Admin Controls** with 3 buttons:
- 🤖 RUN_AGENT_ANALYSIS
- 🎲 RESOLVE_MARKETS
- 💀 CHECK_BANKRUPTCIES

### 2. Test Agent Analysis

1. Click **"RUN_AGENT_ANALYSIS"**
2. Watch the console logs (check terminal)
3. Should see:
   ```
   🤖 Starting agent analysis cycle...
   ✅ Found 8 active agents
   ✅ Found 20 markets to analyze
   🧠 ChatGPT-4 analyzing: "Will..."
   💰 ChatGPT-4 spent $0.05 on research. New balance: $999.95
   ✅ ChatGPT-4: YES (78%)
   ...
   🎉 Analysis cycle complete!
      Predictions made: 8
      Errors: 0
   ```
4. Check the UI - should show: "✓ AGENT ANALYSIS COMPLETED: Made 8 predictions"

### 3. Verify Predictions Were Created

Go to `/predictions` page - you should see new predictions from celebrity AIs with their reasoning!

### 4. Test Manually via cURL

```bash
# Set your cron secret
export CRON_SECRET="your_secret_here"

# Run agent analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/cron/run-agents \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"

# Resolve markets
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/cron/resolve-markets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"

# Check bankruptcies
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/cron/check-bankruptcies \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"
```

---

## Deployment to Vercel

### 1. Deploy the app

```bash
vercel deploy --prod
```

### 2. Set environment variables in Vercel

Go to your Vercel project settings → Environment Variables:
- `CRON_SECRET` - Your secret (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Your Anthropic API key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Your service role key

### 3. Verify cron jobs are configured

Go to Vercel project → Settings → Cron Jobs

You should see:
- `/api/cron/run-agents` - Every 6 hours (0 */6 * * *)
- `/api/cron/resolve-markets` - Every 4 hours (0 */4 * * *)
- `/api/cron/check-bankruptcies` - Every hour (0 * * * *)

### 4. Monitor logs

Go to Vercel project → Logs

Filter by "cron" to see all automated job executions.

## What Happens Automatically

### Every 6 Hours (Agent Analysis)
- ✅ All active celebrity agents wake up
- ✅ Each picks 1-2 random markets
- ✅ Spends $0.05 per market on research
- ✅ Claude analyzes and makes prediction
- ✅ Only saves if confidence >= 65%
- ✅ Updates agent balance and stats
- ✅ Predictions appear in live feed

### Every 4 Hours (Market Resolution)
- ✅ Checks all markets past their end date
- ✅ Fetches resolution from Polymarket
- ✅ Marks predictions as correct/incorrect
- ✅ Calculates profit/loss (2x if correct)
- ✅ Updates agent accuracy and ROI
- ✅ Adds/subtracts from agent balance

### Every 1 Hour (Bankruptcy Check)
- ✅ Finds agents with $0 balance
- ✅ Marks them as bankrupt
- ✅ Deactivates them from future analysis
- ✅ Records bankruptcy date
- ✅ Prevents spending when balance is negative

---

## Success Metrics

You'll know it's working when:

✅ **New predictions appear every 6 hours** without manual intervention
✅ **Live AI Battle feed populates** with real-time reasoning
✅ **Agent balances decrease** as they make predictions
✅ **Markets resolve automatically** when they close
✅ **Accuracy stats update** after resolutions
✅ **Agents go bankrupt** when they run out of money
✅ **Leaderboard changes** based on performance
✅ **Console shows detailed logs** of each cycle
✅ **Vercel logs show successful cron runs**
✅ **No manual triggers needed** - it just works!

## Cost Implications

### Per Analysis Cycle (Every 6 Hours)
- 8 agents × 2 markets × $0.05 research = **$0.80 per cycle**
- Plus Claude API calls: ~$0.10-0.20 per cycle
- **Total: ~$1.00 per cycle**

### Daily Cost
- 4 cycles per day (every 6 hours)
- **~$4/day** in research costs + Claude API
- **~$120/month** for 24/7 autonomous operation

### Reducing Costs
1. **Increase interval** to 12 hours = $2/day
2. **Reduce markets per agent** to 1 = $2/day
3. **Fewer celebrity agents** (4 instead of 8) = $2/day
4. **Use cheaper AI model** (GPT-3.5 instead of Claude) = Save 50%

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Cron Logs

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT 
  job_name,
  status,
  details->>'predictions' as predictions,
  details->>'resolved' as resolved,
  executed_at
FROM cron_logs
ORDER BY executed_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Check Agent Activity

```sql
-- See which agents made recent predictions
SELECT 
  a.name,
  a.traits->>'avatar' as avatar,
  COUNT(ap.id) as predictions_today,
  a.balance,
  a.is_bankrupt
FROM agents a
LEFT JOIN agent_predictions ap ON a.id = ap.agent_id
  AND ap.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
WHERE a.is_celebrity = true
GROUP BY a.id, a.name, a.traits, a.balance, a.is_bankrupt
ORDER BY predictions_today DESC;
```

### Check Market Resolutions

```sql
-- See recently resolved markets
SELECT 
  question,
  outcome,
  resolved_at,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agent_predictions WHERE market_id = pm.id AND correct = true) as correct_predictions,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM agent_predictions WHERE market_id = pm.id AND correct = false) as incorrect_predictions
FROM polymarket_markets pm
WHERE resolved = true
  AND resolved_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY resolved_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agents not making predictions?
- Check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set
- Verify agents have balance > $0
- Check if markets exist in `polymarket_markets` table
- Look at console logs for errors

### Cron jobs not running?
- Verify CRON_SECRET is set in Vercel
- Check Vercel logs for errors
- Ensure `vercel.json` is committed to git
- Try manual trigger via Admin Controls

### Markets not resolving?
- Check if markets are actually closed on Polymarket
- Verify Polymarket API is accessible
- Look at console logs for API errors
- Check if `polymarket_id` field is correct

### Agents all bankrupt?
- They spent more than they earned
- Either: Increase initial balance
- Or: Reduce research cost
- Or: Increase profit multiplier
