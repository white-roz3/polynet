# 🗄️ LOCAL SQLITE DATABASE - SETUP COMPLETE

## ✅ What Was Done

I've set up a **local SQLite database** - no cloud service needed!

---

## 📁 Files Created

1. **`src/lib/db/sqlite.ts`** - Database initialization
2. **`src/lib/db/markets.ts`** - Market operations (get, insert, sync)
3. **`scripts/sync-markets.ts`** - Sync script to fetch from Polymarket
4. **`src/app/api/markets/list/route.ts`** - API to fetch from local DB

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### **Step 1: Sync Markets (One-Time Setup)**

Run this command to populate your local database:

```bash
npm run sync:markets
```

This will:
- Create a `poly402.db` file in your project root
- Fetch 100 markets from Polymarket
- Store them in SQLite
- Take ~10 seconds

Expected output:
```
🌱 SYNCING MARKETS FROM POLYMARKET

🔄 Syncing markets from Polymarket...
✅ Sync complete: 100 added, 0 updated

✅ SUCCESS!
   Added: 100
   Updated: 0
```

### **Step 2: Restart Dev Server**

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### **Step 3: View Markets**

Go to: `http://localhost:3001/markets`

You should now see **100 markets from your local database**!

## 🎯 What You Get

### **Local Database (`poly402.db`)**
- No cloud service needed
- Fast local queries
- Stored in your project folder
- Can be backed up/versioned

### **Three Tables:**
1. **markets** - Prediction markets from Polymarket
2. **agents** - Your AI agents (for future use)
3. **predictions** - Agent predictions (for future use)

### **Auto-Syncing**
You can run `npm run sync:markets` anytime to:
- Add new markets
- Update existing prices
- Keep data fresh

## 🔄 Keep Markets Fresh

Add this to your workflow:

# Sync markets daily
npm run sync:markets

# Or add a cron job (optional)
# 0 */12 * * * cd /path/to/poly402 && npm run sync:markets
```

## 🛠️ Database Location

The database file is created at:
```
/Users/white_roze/Documents/agentseer/poly402.db
```

You can:
- View it with any SQLite browser
- Back it up by copying the file
- Delete it to start fresh
- Commit it to git (optional)

## 🎨 Markets Page Now Uses:

✅ **Local SQLite database** (not Supabase!)  
✅ **No cloud dependencies**  
✅ **Fast local queries**  
✅ **100 real markets**  
✅ **Auto-updates when you sync**  

---

## 🧪 Test It

```bash
# 1. Sync markets
npm run sync:markets

# 2. Start dev server
npm run dev

# 3. Visit markets
open http://localhost:3001/markets

# 4. You should see 100 markets!
```

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **"Cannot find module 'better-sqlite3'"**
Already installed! Just restart your dev server.

### **"Database file not found"**
Run `npm run sync:markets` first to create it.

### **"No markets showing"**
1. Check `poly402.db` exists in project root
2. Run sync again: `npm run sync:markets`
3. Restart dev server
